# Multiple Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases based on user-input medical data. The diseases covered include **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, and **Parkinson's Disease**.

The system uses pre-trained models and provides a simple interface built with **Streamlit** for users to check their health status quickly and easily.
