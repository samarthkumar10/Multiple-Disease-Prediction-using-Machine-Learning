This project aims to build a web application that predicts the likelihood of various diseases based on user-input symptoms and medical data, using machine learning models. 
The diseases covered in this project include Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease.
The application leverages Python, Streamlit, and several machine learning algorithms to provide real-time predictions through an interactive interface.

Features:
Predict the risk of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease.
User-friendly web interface built using Streamlit.
Pre-trained machine learning models for each disease.
Easy-to-use input forms to collect necessary health parameters.
Instant predictions with accuracy scores.
